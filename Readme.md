# Expressions and Keywords in Java

## Keywords

Keywords are  reserved words  in Java that have special meaning to the compiler. Some keywords:

-   `class`
-   `public`
-   `private`
-   `protected`
-   `void`
-   `if`
-   `else`
-   `for`
-   `while`
-   `switch`
-   `return`
-   `break`
-   `continue`

Keywords cannot be used as identifiers (variable names,  class names, etc).

## Expressions

An expression is a combination of operands and operators that evaluate to a value.

Some examples of expressions:

-   Arithmetic  expressions:

Copy

```
int a = 5 + 6;
int b = a * 2; 

```

-   Relational expressions:

Copy

```
a > b
a <= b

```

-   Logical expressions:

Copy

```
a && b
a || b 

```

-   Assignment expressions:

Copy

```
a = b;
c += 5; 

```

-   Variable reference expressions:

Copy

```
String name;
name = "John";

```

-   Increment/decrement expressions:

Copy

```
a++;
b--;

```

-   Method call expressions:

Copy

```
max(a, b) 

```

## Variable Declaration

Variables are declared in Java using:

-   Primitive data types:  `int`,  `double`,  `char`,  `boolean`
-   Reference data types:  `Class`  names

Syntax:

`dataType variableName;`

Example:

`int number;`  
`String name;`

That covers the basics of keywords and expressions in Java! Let me know if you have any other questions.
